# Randomly fills a grid of size 10 x 10 with 0s and 1s and computes:
# - the size of the largest homogenous region starting from the top left corner,
#   so the largest region consisting of connected cells all filled with 1s or
#   all filled with 0s, depending on the value stored in the top left corner;
# - the size of the largest area with a checkers pattern.
